I recommend against that, not least of which is that end systems that are likely to deploy this stuff will have a wide ranging mishmosh of addressing plans, and of course, private network addresses don\u2019t really have any positive security properties to speak of.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect I can see is that one really has to be quite careful of including private network addresses in certificates.  Of course, public trust anchors won\u2019t allow it, but even private ones will have some difficulty.  Your average bank might have multiple overlapping zones of trust - it\u2019s a pretty hairy scene.\r\n",
